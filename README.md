## Purpose

1. Automation Node instance 
2. Automation Node Instance Parameter
3. Automation Node Instance Report


## How to use this tool

The tool usage is covered in detail in the presentation (with screenshots).

## Special Feature

Tools are usually made in such a way that the first time creation (bulk generation) 
of data is easier. Subsequent modification / addition of data have to be done by hand. 
This tool is different in that aspect. Automation Node Instance parameter / report of 
even one equipment can be generated at any time using this tool. This makes it versatile.
